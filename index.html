        <p>Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>wandered in search of a book</span></a>, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>no lack of pious hands</span></a> to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind</span></a> generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-6"><span>absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space</span></a>. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.<a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.)</span></a>Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum:<a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-5"><span>The Library is a sphere</span></a> whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.

        <p>There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-3"><span>uniform format</span></a>; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-2"><span>this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious</span></a>. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-7"><span>its tragic projections</span></a>, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to <a href="https://reesj730.github.io/library-4"><span>recall a few axioms</span></a>.</p>
